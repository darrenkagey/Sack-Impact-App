# Sack Impact App
I built a Shiny App that quantifies individual impact of sacks allowed in the 2023 NFL season. 
The impact of player's allowed sacks are measured using EPA and Win Probability lost on plays where a sack is allowed.

The app also allows the user to view sack impacts in different game situation. One can filter to plays by quarter, field position, down, time to throw, defensive personnel, pass rusher alignment and more.

Some of the data used to make this app is not publicly available, so it is not in this repository.
